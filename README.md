Football Team Cards

This project is an interactive web application showcasing a football team's statistics and player cards, developed using HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6+). It features modular code with reusable functions for rendering player cards via array methods like map and filter, ensuring scalable architecture and code readability. Data is managed through a structured object with destructuring for efficient access, while an event listener on a dropdown enables dynamic filtering of players by position or nickname, promoting maintainable and responsive UI updates. CSS utilizes variables, flexbox for layout, and media queries for cross-browser compatibility and performance optimization
